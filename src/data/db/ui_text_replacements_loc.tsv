The House of Troy flourished under his wise rule, growing prosperous once more, and he forged close alliances with neighbouring states, especially Phrygia, with whom he went to war against the Amazons.

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_unit_spears_2	A major military innovation of the Early Bronze Age, the spear remained an important weapon well into the Trojan War. With a wooden shaft sometimes as long as three metres and tipped with a head of sharpened bronze, they were typically held in both hands and used for thrusting, or braced firmly against the ground to receive the enemy's charge. Spearmen were especially vulnerable when facing highly-mobile units during long melee engagements; when equipped with shields and drilled into tight formations, however, they could form a deadly wall, impervious to missile fire and enemy charges.	true

Then, as prophesised, Zeus and his siblings defeated him in a series of battles called the Titanomachy, winning dominion over the universe.

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_unit_hittites	Although they are never mentioned by name in the Iliad, the powerful Anatolian kingdom of Hatti would have certainly been involved in the events of the Trojan War. Hittite writings contemporary to the Trojan War corroborate the broad strokes of Homer's account; Troy was known to them as Wilusa, and their historical records mention Alaksandu, a likely reference to Alexander, another name for Paris. It is likely that the Hittite king sent troops to assist the Wilusans, to honour a prior mutual assistance treaty and prevent an Achaean incursion into Anatolia.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_unit_gorgon	The three Gorgons were powerful mythological figures whose origins are as ancient as Zeus himself. They were depicted as hideous women with hair of living snakes and such dreadful faces that men would turn to stone at a mere glance. Legend claims the great Perseus slayed the Gorgon Medusa, avoiding her petrifying stare by looking at her in the reflection of his shield. The hero later gave the monster's head to Athena, who, according to Homer, affixed it to her mighty aegis. In the Iliad, a replica of the terrifying visage also adorned Agamemnon's shield throughout the Trojan War.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_bankruptcy	Should any of your resource stockpiles fall to zero, you will go bankrupt. Bankruptcy generally occurs due to overspending on military recruitment or civic construction - i.e. if military upkeep exceeds per-turn income, the gradual loss of funds will result eventually result in bankruptcy. If you go bankrupt, Happiness will suffer and your armies will begin to desert. When approaching bankruptcy, steps must be taken to balance the books. Disbanding units to re-coup their upkeep cost, brokering fresh Barter agreements, or constructing buildings that bring in income are the most effective methods of bolstering your treasury, but remember you can also defeat foreign Heroes or just raid enemy territory for a short-term gain.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_battle_battlefield	Broadly speaking, the battlefield is the playable area in which a battle takes place, boxed in by the outfield, its boundary marked by a red line. The line is highlighted when approached with the camera. Battles cannot be fought in the outfield and units that pass over the boundary cannot be recovered or rallied. There are many terrain types that may feature on a battlefield. Terrain can be both advantageous and disadvantageous, depending on army composition, numbers, and whether you are attacking or defending. The most satisfying victories are those which marry superior tactics and with clever use of battlefield topography, even in the face of the most overwhelming odds. The full extent of a battlefield can be viewed on the radar map or the tactical map, accessed via the dedicated button on the battle HUD.	true

She was also known as a protector of women throughout Achaea and Anatolia; in Attica, for instance, pre-pubescent girls were sent to her sanctuary at Brauron, where they would serve her for a year. Despite her maidenhood, she was considered a maternal goddess across Asia Minor, guarding women's vows of chastity or assisting mothers with childbirth.	true

The device's earlier versions featured a large trunk, with a ram-shaped iron cap, that was suspended from a wooden frame which could be swung against walls or gates by moving the whole structure back and forth. While historical accounts of the Trojan War make no references to battering rams, it is still possible that they were employed during the conflict: if so, they might have been misremembered as mythological creatures, given their animal-like appearance and the use of soaked hides to counter flaming arrows.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_amazons_unit_furies	Perhaps as a reflection of their purported savagery and barbaric ways, the Amazons were portrayed in ancient Greek myths as devout followers and direct descendants of the Olympian Ares. The Argonautica claims that they were the progeny of the god of war and the nymph Harmonia, while in other tales, the dark deity sired some of their mightiest queens. It was Ares himself who gave his daughter Hippolyta her fabled magic girdle, while Penthesilea, a tragic figure of the Trojan War, was said to have been born from the union of Ares and the Amazon queen Otrera.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_battle_visibility	All units have a maximum sight range or 'visibility'. On a flat terrain, they can see up to the same maximum distance after which they will no longer be able to discern distant objects. However, geographical features such as hills, forests and mountains will block their line of sight and impair their visibility, hiding them from the enemy yet preventing them from seeing anything beyond.\\n\\n Forests provide a natural barrier to visibility, so hiding units there is a good tactic provided they do not run whilst concealed, which will inadvertently reveal their position to the enemy. The gradient of the battlefield also affects each army's line of sight; units behind a hill will be obscured from view and won't be able to see one another until they reach the crest and establish line of sight. 	true

Despite being a god of healing, Apollo was also the bringer of disease with his divine bow: in the Iliad, he was responsible for the plague that befell the Achaean army, which indirectly led to the rift between Agamemnon and Achilles. Legend also claims that he guided the arrow, fired by Paris, that mortally wounded the great hero Achilles in the heel.\\n\\n	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_menelaus_sparta	Glorious Menelaus, king of Sparta, was the younger sibling of Agamemnon of Mycenae and husband to Helen. When Paris seduced his wife and fled with her to Troy, Menelaus joined his brother's alliance and crossed the Aegean Sea, consumed by revenge.\\n\\nAlthough his best days on the battlefield were already behind him at the start of the Trojan War, the mighty warrior still inspired awe and fear. He favoured power over cunning in the manner of his peerless Spartan warriors, clad in heavy armour and wielding a great spear. According to the Iliad, he overpowered Paris himself in single combat only to be denied his bloody vengeance when the goddess Aphrodite intervened in the Trojan prince's favour.\\n\\nBut the formidable commander was not without mercy; to him, violence was but a means to an end, and one he gladly set aside when a better path presented itself.	true
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_main_core_temple_poseidon	Ill-tempered Poseidon was the god of the seas and elder brother to Zeus. As a punishment for his defiance, the king of the gods forced him to build the glorious walls of Troy with the help of Apollo; but because King Laomedon refused to pay him for his work, the lord of the ocean decided to side with the Achaeans in the Trojan War. As the Olympian was credited in myth for creating the horse, historians speculate that the story of the Trojan Horse actually refers to an earthquake sent by Poseidon to punish the city.	true

However, note that skirmishing can cause your units to break formation, which in turn can have a disastrous effect on your battle plan. Skirmish mode is also no guarantee of successfully avoiding the enemy – if your units are fatigued, penned in, or outpaced by faster units, they may still be caught and attacked.

Priam himself fought alongside King Mygdon against the Amazons a generation before the Trojan War, securing the Phrygians' assistance against Troy's enemies. Besides being renowned for its men's bravery and expert horsemanship, the Anatolian state is also famous for King Midas, a ruler who lived in the 2nd millennium BC and who, according to Greek mythology, turned anything he touched into gold.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_main_core_builders	The Late Bronze Age was a period of intense conflict around the Aegean, a fact that was reflected in the brutal efficiency of its architecture. Many Achaean settlements were surrounded by massive stone barriers that served both as defences and as a testament to their ruler's power and prestige. Homer himself heaped praise on the awe-inspiring walls of Troy, which, legend claims, were raised by the gods Poseidon and Apollo. Particularly impressive were Mycenae's Cyclopean structures, so called because they were assembled from gigantic unshaped rocks, creating the illusion that they were built by the mighty Cyclopes.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_army_movement	To move an army, simply select it and right-click on any terrain within the yellow movement zone that appears. The extent of the yellow zone is the maximum distance your force can move in a single turn. If you click beyond the zone, it will continue on its journey during the next turn. If you right-click on one of your own settlements, the army will move into and garrison it. Right-clicking on another of your armies enables the exchange of units between the two when positioned close to one another on the campaign map. Armies can also move over water, but it takes time to construct and dismantle transport ships, unless through a port, delaying the journey. Only beaches and ports can be used as embarkation points - mountains and rocky shores are, naturally, inaccessible. Note that sea-borne armies also suffer attrition if they stray too far from the coast.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_paris_troy_of_paris	Paris, son of Priam and a favourite of the goddess Aphrodite, is remembered for instigating the Trojan War by stealing beautiful Helen away from the Spartan king Menelaus and marrying her himself. Despite this act of romantic hubris, the prince, much like his elder brother Hector, was a skilled warrior and clever military commander who was willing to sacrifice his life in service to his people. His new wife accompanied him wherever he went, supporting the efforts of her beloved husband at every opportunity.\\n\\nParis, like much of the Trojan nobility, learned to use a bow and lead men from early childhood. On the battlefield, he preferred to keep his distance from the melee, firing deadly arrows from afar. In Greek legend, Paris is credited with bringing down mighty Achilles by mortally wounding him in the heel – by which his mother held him when she dipped him into the River Styx to confer invulnerability upon her baby son and protect him from the prophecy of his early death.	true

As lord of fertile and prosperous Dardania, he fought with honour and dignity, commanding the vast numbers of conscripts at his disposal to overwhelm his enemies on the battlefield.\\n\\nThe gods of Olympus may have had a greater destiny in mind when they decided to favour the Dardanian ruler: in the Aeneid, Virgil claims that the king and his men fled west after the Trojan War, settling in Italy where they became the progenitors of the Roman people.

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_battle_terrain_types_hills	Hills are valuable tactical positions to occupy. Missile units at a higher elevation generally have a clearer field of fire, and gain a damage bonus based on that elevation above the target.

Units charging downhill will gather greater momentum, enhancing their impact damage; conversely, troops charging uphill will do so more slowly, reducing their impact damage.

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_unit_attributes	Attributes are the innate, 'passive' abilities that units can use to govern their capabilities in battle. As such, they do not generally have to be activated, although an attribute may bestow an ability activated by a button on the battle HUD. For example, some units are inherently fearsome, so their very presence in battle can cause fear to an enemy, reducing their morale. Similarly, some units can hide, enabling them to remain out of sight of enemies within a certain distance.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_amazons_hippolyta_military	While the majority of Bronze Age religious rituals were practiced openly, a number of ancillary cults, called 'Mysteries', were conducted in secret among chosen initiates. These arcane practices, most likely evolved from much older agrarian faiths, grew in parallel with public religion and were widespread around the Aegean Sea and beyond. One such group, known today as the Eleusinian Mysteries, was already ancient in the days of Mycenaean Greece and lasted until the 4th century AD, while another sect from central Anatolia worshipped enigmatic chthonic deities named the Cabiri, whose origins precede the Greek gods themselves.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_main_core_farm_apoikia	Whether city-states sought to expand their influence to farther regions of the world or were displaced by war, they would sometimes found colonies called 'apoikia'. These settlements in distant lands acted as sovereign entities but maintained close economic and social ties with their metropolis of origin, in effect acting as advanced posts. This was the case in Anatolia, which saw an influx of colonial communities originating in Mycenae, ensuring an Achaean presence across the Aegean for centuries to come.	true

Formation groups differ from selection groups because when a formation group is selected for movement the units will always manoeuvre while holding the formation they were in when the group was created. Selection groups do not hold formation and are mostly used for unit selection purposes. Whenever formation presets are chosen, the formation group system takes effect, creating a group number and automatically moving all grouped units into the chosen formation which they will hold until they are ungrouped.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_game_guide_campaign_UI_strategic_map	The strategic overview map, accessed from the Toggle Strategic Overview button in the top-right of the campaign HUD, provides you with a top-level view of the campaign map. It shows a much wider and more detailed view of the Old World than the actual campaign map, with several toggles and filters with which to better manage your campaign. At the top, there are two sections – filters and overlays. The filters show you points of interest on the campaign map, like settlements, resources, Heroes and armies, as well as any ongoing sieges. These filters can be turned on and off by left-clicking their checkboxes. The overlays allow you to change what the colourisation of the map represents. Its default setting is region ownership, but it can also be changed to show diplomatic status, diplomatic attitude, regional wealth, happiness, growth, and divine favour. The legend in the top-right of the campaign HUD explains what the colour gradient represents.

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_gaf_bio_hera_3	Described as jealous and vindictive, Hera often schemed against Zeus' conquests and made life difficult for his illegitimate progeny.

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_achilles_phthia	Swift-footed Achilles, legendary hero of the Iliad, was the mightiest warrior the world has ever known. His seeming invincibility in combat was the subject of myth and conjecture: legend claims that his mother, the sea-goddess Thetis, granted him invulnerability as an infant by dipping him head first into the waters of the Styx. Such was his might that no other man could lift his massive spear of Pelian ash.\\n\\nAchilles was the leader of the Myrmidons, an elite fighting force from Phthia said to have been created by Zeus himself from a colony of ants. Fiercely loyal, they fought with ferocity and overcame unsurmountable odds through sheer, unflinching determination.\\n\\nWhile Achilles' mere presence was often enough to turn the tide of battle, the Phthian champion was prone to great, unpredictable mood swings that could either shake or bolster the resolve of the entire Achaean host.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_main_core_forest_furnace	Although iron was known to the people of Mycenae and Troy, it would only achieve prominence following the massive collapse of civilisation that marked the end of the Bronze Age. At the time of the Trojan War, bronze was still favoured by smiths as it was easier to work with, and for its higher durability compared to wrought iron. Eventually, however, the rarity of tin, which had to be imported from distant lands, as well as the deforestation caused by the need for charcoal to heat forges, led to improvements in metalworking techniques, ushering in the Iron Age.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_campaign_factions_2	Epic Heroes are the faction leaders – the figureheads and overall controllers of the many factions in the game. They cannot be slain, so if they fall in battle, they will spend some turns recovering from their wounds before returning to take command once again. Should this happen, you will be prompted to choose another character to lead whilst they are away.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_gameplay_trojan_horses_gifts_desc_01	A second explanation for the myth of the Trojan Horse supposes that the stratagem was a ploy by Odysseus to infiltrate the walls of Troy through a ruse. In this version of the events, the legendary horse was a boat loaded with treasure, as ships of the Late Bronze Age Aegean often featured horse-headed prows.	true
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_truth_behind_the_legend	The events surrounding the Trojan war are steeped in legend, with mythological creatures, superhuman Heroes and the intervention of gods all descending upon this cataclysmic conflict. However, little is known about the real-world events that occurred during the Late Bronze Age, with many of its kings, queens, and artefacts lost to the annals of history. As a result, examining the truth behind the myth of Homer’s Iliad has become a key design pillar for A Total War Saga: TROY as we attempt to reveal the truth that might have inspired this most cherished era. One of the most apparent examples of this is the shroud used throughout the campaign map, which is adorned with mythical art and excerpts from Homer’s Iliad for unexplored regions, but when the player expands their borders it burns away the mythical homage and reveals the historically-grounded campaign map.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_battle_locked_formation_groups	Units that have been formed into groups can be set into fixed formations designed to enable certain types of strategy. Notice the group formation options slide out from the bottom of the screen when a group is selected. Pressing Ctrl + G automatically creates a formation group (as opposed to G which creates a selection group). Formation groups differ from selection groups because when a formation group is selected for movement the units will always manoeuvre while holding the formation they were in when the group was created. Selection groups do not hold formation and are mostly used for unit selection purposes. Whenever formation presets are chosen, the formation group system takes effect, creating a group number and automatically moving all grouped units into the chosen formation which they will hold until they are ungrouped.	true

Different terrain greatly influences the chances of successfully triggering an ambush battle; desert offers a low chance, grassland a medium one, forests and mountains a high chance, and hilly woodlands the best chance.	true

Wood in the Late Bronze Age was a precious commodity, used extensively in shipbuilding, in the construction of chariots, as charcoal to heat forges, and in the creation of weapons such as bows and spear shafts. Finally, forests also offered clever villagers a reliable source of game meat and a place to disappear should an enemy raider ever show up on their doorstep.	true

Too soft to be used for weapons or tools, the precious metal was employed for decorative purposes, flattened into thin sheets and used for plating swords and armour. Artefacts recovered from Mycenaean sites suggest that the goldsmiths of the Late Bronze Age were highly skilled, creating pieces of jewellery and adorning hilts with intricate patterns.

As a commander, he expected cunning from his men, and taught them that outsmarting the enemy invariably trumps brute force. The warriors who accompanied the Ithacan ruler to Troy are famous in their own right: their trials and tribulations along their ten-year journey home at the conclusion of the Trojan War were immortalised in Homer's second epic poem, 'The Odyssey'.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_main_core_recruitment_ranged	Although warfare in the Late Bronze Age was often conducted at close quarters, ranged units still played a key strategic role in the majority of battles. Skirmishers mingled with heavy infantry, raining slingshot and arrows upon the enemy line in order to break their resolve or soften them up for a charge. Light spears called javelins were also hurled from a distance before closing ranks. For archers and slingers, movement mattered more than protection; they were expected to carry out their attack, then withdraw from battle while armoured warriors gained all the glory in the ensuing melee.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_main_mycenae_agamemnon_statue	While the story of Helen's flight to Troy makes for a lyrical explanation for the start of the Trojan War, it's unlikely to have been the main reason so many Achaean states engaged in a decade of bloody conflict. If Homer's portrayal of Agamemnon is to be believed, it is more likely that the great Mycenaean king employed the perceived kidnapping of his brother's wife as a convenient justification for war, thus feeding his own bottomless appetite for conquest. In the end, the kings of the Aegean would have probably gone to war regardless of Paris' foolish actions.	true

Despite having no qualms with the Achaeans, the Lycians fought with ferocity and valour to defend their esteemed Trojan allies. When Hector led Troy's forces against the newly-built Achaean wall they were at the forefront of the battle, holding the battlements and entering the enemy encampment first. Their contribution to the battle granted Troy a much-needed victory against the foreign invaders.	true

War was a major source of captives, as tradition at the time stated that the victor had absolute rights over a defeated enemy. The primary employment of slaves was in agriculture, although they were not barred from any profession except politics; many were even allowed to own land or march into war.	true
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_unit_achaean_bow	As with countless other military campaigns throughout the ages, the bow played a critical role in Aegean warfare. Achaean archers typically wore little to no protection, relying instead on heavy infantry to keep the enemy at bay. They were best deployed before a charge, raining arrows on the enemy from the back to harass the opposition and break the line. The invention of the more compact and balanced composite bow, crafted from laminated horn, wood, and sinew, meant the weapon could also be fired with great accuracy from the backs of chariots.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_battle_fire_at_will	All missile units have access to the "Fire-at-Will" ability, which can be toggled on and off using the button on the battle HUD. When toggled on, a missile unit will select its own targets automatically unless you intervene and specifically order it to fire at something else. When toggled off, it will not fire at all unless specifically ordered to do so. Although requiring a greater level of battle management, deactivating it conserves ammunition and reduces the likelihood of friendly fire and collateral damage taking place. Conversely, leaving the feature activated – its default state – can be useful when defending, as your missile units will automatically fire on any enemy units that march into their firing arcs, which hopefully reduces the amount of costly melee required to achieve victory.	true

Skilled physicians, they relied on their extensive training and the counsel of animals and stars to decide how best to heal the injured and the sick.

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_priestess	As the self-proclaimed representatives of Olympus on earth, the priests and priestesses of the Late Bronze Age wielded considerable power all around the Aegean Sea. It is even likely that kings themselves fulfilled priestly functions, thus strengthening their legitimacy in the eyes of a superstitious population. In addition to officiating ceremonies such as weddings and burials, the priesthood beseeched divine favour, performed prescribed sacrifices and interpreted the many omens and portents that punctuated life in Mycenaean Greece, thus exerting great influence over states which dared not defy the will of their gods.	true
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_game_guide_campaign_UI_province_overview_panel	Whenever a settlement is selected, the Province Overview panel is displayed. This shows you all the settlements in a province and their constituent buildings, as well as any construction currently taking place. The arrows to either side of your province's name will move the Province Overview panel's view to the next province under your control and pan the camera to its capital. When moused over, the building icons and empty building slots in your settlements show potential building chains. If you have the necessary funds and requirements, click on a building card to construct or upgrade something. More information on each building is available on the Building Info panel, which is on the left-hand side of the screen when you mouse over a building. The Garrison Details button at the bottom of the panel enables you to view your settlements' defending garrison units.

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_main_core_wine	A favourite around the Aegean for nearly seven thousand years, wine evolved from a commoner's drink in Neolithic times to a delicacy prized by the elite in the days of the Trojan War. Most of today's production techniques have roots in Bronze Age methods; harvested grapes were first crushed using a stone press, then stored in clay jugs to mature. In addition to its trade value, the elegant beverage played an important social and religious role - the cult of Dionysus, god of winemaking, attests to the practice's importance in the eyes of the Mycenaeans.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_battle_morale_1	Morale is the measure of units' willingness to fight. Each one has a morale rating, which differs according to its quality. Inexpensive conscripted units will begin the battle with lower maximum morale than grizzled veterans, for example, making them more likely to flee the battle when faced with the true horrors of war.	true
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_main_core_stone_settlement	Despite the paramount importance of metalworking, stone remained a favourite of builders and crafters alike well into the Late Bronze Age. Given the material's low cost and high availability, it was often the material of choice to erect walls around cities, and it was shaped into primitive tools for farmers and weapons for skirmishers. One particular type of architecture, Cyclopean masonry, involved the stacking of massive, ostensibly unshaped stones to create an awe-inspiring construction that appeared to have been erected by the Cyclops of legend.	true

The fates of any prisoners you have captured during the battle – to release or to kill them, for instance – can be decided at the bottom of this panel.

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_battle_vigour_4	Some useful ways to reduce the effects of fatigue are to walk your troops into position when the battle begins rather than running them. Also, if you have the luxury of numbers on your side, consider holding a few units back when you commit your army to battle.

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_penthesilea_horde_play_style	Horde factions, such as Penthesilea's, do not own land but instead roam the world, usually leaving a trail of destruction in their wake due to the fact that they cannot occupy settlements but only sack or raze them instead. A horde gains growth just like a settlement, so growth is a prerequisite for horde building construction. Horde growth can be spent on Hero recruitment, which effectively creates an additional roaming horde. Be aware that horde armies cannot reinforce one another.	true

These massive constructions, covered in soaked horse hides and decorated like giant beasts, would have made quite an impression on Homer’s predecessors, whose dramatised tales of these terrible contraptions would have later given birth to stories of the Trojan Horse.	true
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_amazons_unit_hippomachoi	A plausible historical origin for the mythological Amazons is the Pazyryk, a Bronze Age people related to the Scythians. The excavation of burial mounds in Siberia has revealed the mummified bodies of bow-legged women bearing battle scars, suggesting they rode horses throughout their lives and participated in armed conflicts. If these were indeed the Amazons of legend, then the fabled warriors were among the first in human history to wage war on horseback, a fact corroborated by the many accounts from Ancient Greece describing their exceptional equestrian skills.	true

The line is highlighted when approached with the camera. Battles cannot be fought in the outfield and units that pass over the boundary cannot be recovered or rallied. There are many terrain types that may feature on a battlefield. Terrain can be both advantageous and disadvantageous, depending on army composition, numbers, and whether you are attacking or defending. The most satisfying victories are those which marry superior tactics and with clever use of battlefield topography, even in the face of the most overwhelming odds.

Taking on the name Penthesilea, meaning 'strong grief', she offered her life to the bloodthirsty god Ares, swearing to visit vengeance upon those who had dared desecrate the golden capital.\\n\\nAccording to the Homeric tradition, she fought against the Achaeans in the war, rescuing Troy from certain defeat. Achilles himself killed her in single combat, only to fall in love with her upon removing her helmet.

If you go bankrupt, Happiness will suffer and your armies will begin to desert. When approaching bankruptcy, steps must be taken to balance the books.

Achaeans and Anatolians alike grew a variety of crops including wheat, barley, oats, and millet, while familiar staples such as olive oil and wine already occupied a place of honour on the Mycenaean table. The peoples of the Aegean ate fish, but they also raised cows, sheep, goats, and pigs. All of these elements combined in a simple yet nutritious diet whose basic tenets have survived into modern times.	true

Sailors made offerings to Poseidon hoping for calm seas, while overland travellers begged Apollo and Artemis for kind weather, or entreated Hermes, patron of roads and travel, to keep them safe. Not wanting to be remiss of their spiritual duty, the peoples of the Aegean Sea would visit sanctuaries and shrines along their journey, carrying with them symbols and icons of their chosen deities to ensure they would reach their destination safely.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_amazons_hippolyta_chariot	As with many other martial abilities, warriors of the Late Bronze Age honed and measured their chariot-riding skills through intense competition, as evidenced by depictions of sporting events on Mycenaean pottery. These races, most often held during religious festivals, were considered extremely dangerous for both riders and horses, as the wagons were prone to topple over on sharp turns or smash together in deadly collisions, inevitably adding to the spectators' excitement. Homer describes one such contest during the funeral games held for Achilles' companion Patroclus, which Diomedes won by defeating the likes of King Menelaus.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_unit_aristomachoi	Myths tell of the Amazonomachies, a series of savage battles opposing Ancient Greece and the Amazons. These tales depict the Amazons as barbaric female warriors whose brutality stands in stark contrast to the Greeks' civilised conception of honour. The most famous of these stories recounts how Heracles travelled to Themiscyra to claim Hippolyta's girdle as his own for his ninth labour, while another describes how the Thracian hero Penthesilea fought on Troy's side in the Trojan War. According to the Aethiopis, she was killed in single combat by Achilles, who then fell in love with her upon removing her helmet.	true

In Anatolia, expertise in curatives was often the exclusive domain of women, who dispensed them through religious rituals and practices. Such was the case of the Hasawas of the Kingdom of Hatti, healers and priests whose knowledge of herbal medicine, combined with their spiritual functions, conferred them great political power and influence in Hittite society.

Fortifications, erected from mud bricks or stone blocks, were often combined with deep trenches and wooden palisades to discourage attackers, while larger cities employed double sets of walls to create choke points from which defenders could launch a counterattack. Common defensive strategies included archers firing from above and large stones thrown from atop the battlements.

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_main_core_bronze_artisans	The production of bronze around the time of the Trojan War required two naturally-occurring metals, copper and tin. The former was readily available throughout the Aegean Sea, most notably on the island of Cyprus, which supplied the bulk of Mycenae's needs. The latter, however, proved much more elusive; to secure this rare substance, the Mycenaeans relied on foreign sources, importing it via extensive trade routes stretching as far as the British Isles. For this reason, the precious alloy was prized for both its sturdiness and its scarcity, shaped into intricate jewellery or used to adorn the tombs of kings.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_unit_sword_2	Introduced in the Late Bronze Age, the slashing or 'grip-tongue' sword would remain a fixture of battlefields the world over well into the Iron Age, five centuries later. Sturdy enough to cut through armour and flesh alike, the weapon was a favourite of both Achaean and Trojan soldiers, and was carried by everyone from skirmishers to heavy infantry. For archers, a blade was often their last hope of survival when an enemy closed the gap and engaged them at close quarters.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_main_core_coastal_settlement	Coastal settlements played a key role in the Late Bronze Age for both strategic and trade reasons. Access to the sea allowed fishermen to supplement the state's diet with nourishing seafood, while traders criss-crossing the Aegean boosted trade by importing wares and precious materials from foreign lands. At the time of the Trojan War, communities were rarely established directly on the waterfront, as doing so would expose them to inclement weather and the occasional seaborne raid. Instead, housing units were built a short distance away, connected to the beachfront via a short road.	true
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_battle_damage_types_base	Base damage is the regular, unmodified form of damage that one unit causes another. All units have a damage characteristic which determines the damage they cause.

In the campaign, units are recruited into armies and cost upkeep each turn to maintain. In battle, the troops in each unit move and fight together, responding to orders as a single entity, and have a single combined morale rating which rises or falls according to their unit’s circumstances in the heat of battle. Units also have a vigour rating which reduces over time according to their activities, reducing their movement speed and effectiveness in combat.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_unit_clubs	Despite the domination of the Anatolian battlefield by the so-called 'grip-tongue' sword, use of Neolithic-style blunt weapons persisted through the Bronze Age right up to the Trojan War. Maces, hammers, and clubs were unwieldy in the close quarters of a compact melee, but a strong warrior could devastate all but the most heavily-armoured opponent if given enough space for a mighty swing. On the other hand, their weight made their wielders prone to exhaustion, and vulnerable to a well-placed spear thrust or the quick slash of a blade.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_campaign_army_movement	To move an army, simply select it and right-click on any terrain within the yellow movement zone that appears. The extent of the yellow zone is the maximum distance your force can move in a single turn. If you click beyond the zone, it will continue on its journey during the next turn. If you right-click on one of your own settlements, the army will move into and garrison it. Right-clicking on another of your armies enables the exchange of units between the two when positioned close to one another on the campaign map. Armies can also move over water, but it takes time to construct and dismantle transport ships, unless through a port, delaying the journey. Only beaches and ports can be used as embarkation points – mountains and rocky shores are, naturally, inaccessible. Note that sea-borne armies also suffer attrition if they stray too far from the coast.	true

They provide focused functionality on the battlefield outside the normal factional army composition options. Mythical units draw upon the legends surrounding them, but under the veil of fantastical mystique, they remain very much human!\\n\\n* Giants: a rarely-encountered tribe of oversized warriors, giants cause fear and may be armed and armoured in different ways. Their size grants them very high melee and/or missile damage, and they have the Cause Fear unit attribute. \\n* Centaurs: Savage tribes of horse-riding warriors, the Centaurs are the closest the period has to true cavalry. They may be armed and armoured in different ways. \\n* Harpies: Taking after the vicious spirits serving Zeus, the Harpies are mobile skirmishers that excel in hit-and-run tactics. \\n* Sirens: Much like the alluring beings of legends, the Sirens can charm enemy units into approaching them while pelting them with their slings. \\n\\n All these units can be found in specific provinces all over the campaign map. \\n\\n* Cyclops: an exceptionally large individual, the Cyclops is nonetheless a man, albeit an extremely large one. With extremely high weapon damage and hit points, the ability to toss great boulders, and the power to smash down city gates, he is truly a force to be reckoned with. The cyclops is unlocked via reaching maximum cult level with Poseidon. \\n* Minotaur: A hulking individual wearing a bull's skull as a helmet. With extremely high weapon damage, the ability to smash city gates, the Cause Fear unit attribute, and two unique battle abilities, he is a powerful addition to any army. The Minotaur is unlocked via reaching maximum cult level with Zeus.\\n* Corybantes: Their origins lie in the legend of the warriors appointed by Rhea to guard infant Zeus against the cannibalistic appetites of his father, Cronus. They are highly resilient in battle and can use the Shield Wall Formation ability. The Corybantes are unlocked via reaching maximum cult level with Hera. \\n* Spartoi: Based on the legends of warriors who sprouted from dragons' teeth, the Spartoi are ferocious in battle and deadly on the charge. They can go berserk, which increases their combat potential but makes them uncontrollable. The Spartoi are unlocked via reaching maximum cult level with Ares.	true

The prince was renowned for his courage and unwavering devotion, leading the war effort against the Achaeans despite his objections to the conflict. Likewise, when Paris returned from Sparta with Menelaus' wife Helen, Hector voiced his disapproval but stood firm by his younger brother.\\n\\nThe noble warrior, raised from birth to lead his father's armies, was feared by his enemies and could turn the tide of battle through sheer bravado and military cunning.

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_main_core_mountain_settlement	With the increase in coastal raids during the Bronze Age, settlements near the water were gradually abandoned in favour of locations considered easier to safeguard from invaders. Hill and mountain cities farther from the coast were safe from attacks by sea, while natural features such as cliffs and ravines supplemented man-made defensive structures such as walls and ditches. On the other hand, the lack of arable fields meant these hard-to-reach communities were more reliant on farmlands down on the plains, and thus more vulnerable to siege warfare.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_amazons_unit_toxoannases	Given that the Amazon people were most likely of Scythian origin, it is a distinct possibility that they too practiced mounted archery. Shooting a bow from horseback required great riding skills, which is consistent with depictions of Amazons in Greek legend. These horse archers would have been experts skirmishers, using their mounts' speed to get close to the enemy, then fleeing as they fired arrows backwards, thus thinning the enemy's numbers and crushing their morale. They would have wielded shorter bows than usual, trading range and penetration power for mobility and manoeuvrability.	true
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_merging_and_disbanding_units	When several units of the same type in your army have suffered casualties, you can merge them together to replenish their numbers and preserve their experience. If, before merging, there are not enough troops to form a full unit when the two are combined, they will become a single unit fighting at less than full strength - e.g. 100/120. However, if the total number of troops exceed the maximum size, then one remains smaller whilst the other unit will be replenished entirely. Alternatively, if you feel a unit is not worth saving, and you wish to save on upkeep costs, you may disband it by selecting its unit card, then selecting disband on the pop-up user interface.	true
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_battle_negative_modifiers_1	There are many events in battle which will reduce unit morale. A unit that stands alone in the field, loses individual soldiers, gets attacked in the flank or rear, or becomes surrounded and outnumbered in combat will suffer morale loss. This makes flanking an important tactic. Three units attacking a single unit in the front, side and rear will rapidly reduce its morale and force it to rout.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_main_core_granary	Given its essential role in feeding the army and the population, grain could be considered the real gold of the Late Bronze Age. Rulers around the Aegean collected wheat or barley from the farmers as a form of taxation, which they then stored in large stone or brick granaries. This shrewd practice ensured protection against famine in cases of drought, but also played a critical part in keeping the ruling elite alive in the event of a prolonged siege. For this reason, food stores were often the most heavily-guarded part of any city.	true

The ancient Greeks called them 'Illyrians', but the archaeological record suggests the term designates a great number of different tribes rather than a unified kingdom with a singular culture, spread across parts of what is now Italy and the western coast of the Balkan Peninsula. Despite being considered little more than bloodthirsty savages by the Mycenaeans, the Illyrians were skilled traders who relied heavily on commerce with their neighbours, including Achaea.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_amazons_penthesilea_resource_cap	As horseback riding as a military discipline had yet to arise at the time of the Trojan War, the animal's main use, besides pulling chariots, was as beast of burden. This was especially true for nomadic tribes, since travel overland in the Late Bronze Age was often arduous and perilous. Horses made excellent chariot pullers, covering great distances if the terrain allowed, but they were too scrawny at the time to bear significant weights on their backs. It would take centuries of selective breeding and improved nutrition for them to develop the muscular structure necessary to efficiently carry heavily-armoured soldiers.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_amazons_penthesilea_upgrades	While bronze weapons were exceptionally sturdy even in comparison to iron, they still required great expertise to produce and maintain. They were important status symbols, attesting to the exceptional skill needed to forge them, as well as the rarity of tin, a critical component that had to be imported over vast distances. While bronze blades did not rust, they had a tendency to break or chip, and the metal's malleability meant it lost its edge quicker. All these factors ensured that smiths were held in high regard, as they kept armies supplied with well-maintained, quality weaponry.	true
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_campaign_diplomacy_elements_confederation	Confederation is where one faction takes complete ownership of another's regions and settlements, resources, generals, armies and agents – the confederated faction is effectively dissolved, with all assets passing to the confederating faction. Note however that suddenly gaining additional armies may increase unit upkeep to unacceptable levels, and also that a very high diplomatic attitude is required in order to achieve confederation in the first place.	true
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_gameplay_hero_classes_desc_01	All Heroes available for recruitment fall into one of four broad archetypes: fighters, archers, warlords, and defenders. These archetypes represent the type of support a given Hero can provide to their armies; for instance, fighter Heroes focus on dealing direct damage, while archers specialise in missile warfare.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_fire_at_will	All missile units have access to the "Fire-at-Will" ability, which can be toggled on and off using the button on the battle HUD. When toggled on, a missile unit will select its own targets automatically unless you intervene and specifically order it to fire at something else. When toggled off, it will not fire at all unless specifically ordered to do so. Although requiring a greater level of battle management, deactivating it conserves ammunition and reduces the likelihood of friendly fire and collateral damage taking place. Conversely, leaving the feature activated – its default state – can be useful when defending, as your missile units will automatically fire on any enemy units that march into their firing arcs, which hopefully reduces the amount of costly melee required to achieve victory.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_unit_khopesh	A major imperial power from across the Mediterranean, Egypt was well-known to both Anatolians and Achaeans throughout the Late Bronze Age. While historical records and Homeric accounts do not support their involvement in the Trojan War, it is fair to assume that they provided mercenary forces in some capacity, as was often the case with other states bordering the Aegean Sea. These hired soldiers would have wielded the dreaded khopesh, a distinctive sword evolved from the epsilon-shaped axe that featured a curved blade used for both slashing and bludgeoning.	true

Their name is derived from the word for ants, 'murmekes'; while legend claims that they were created by Zeus when the king of the gods transformed an ant colony into men, it is more likely a reference to their steel discipline and unwavering morale, granting them an overwhelming advantage over all but the most battle-hardened troops.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_main_hector_trojan_tower	After successfully defending its strategic position at the entrance to the Hellespont for centuries, Troy in the Late Bronze Age had evolved magnificent defences that only the most determined or foolhardy attacker could ever hope to breach. The city's awe-inspiring walls, standing at eight metres tall and five wide, were believed to have been erected by Poseidon and Apollo themselves. Ultimately, not even the assembled Achaean host could knock down its reinforced gates: it took all of Odysseus' treachery and cunning to make his way inside, hiding with a handful of elite warriors within the infamous Trojan Horse.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_unit_axe_2	A carryover from Neolithic times, axemen maintained their relevance on the Achaean battlefield thanks to the introduction of improved Bronze Age metalworking techniques. Often forged out of arsenical copper, two-handed axes could cleave through bronze armour if swung with enough power, while the smaller, one-handed versions were carried alongside a shield to swiftly dispatch light infantry. Besides their use as tools and weapons, the archaeological record shows they also played an important role in religious rituals in ancient Crete, where the double-headed labrys was closely associated with the goddesses of the Minoan religion.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_main_miletus_way	Devoted to Apollo, the god of prophecy, the shrine at Miletus was home to a prominent oracle, second only in importance to Delphi. The sanctuary was modest compared to the temple built in its place in the Classical Period, but it still played a vital spiritual role at the time of the Trojan War. To reach the site, pilgrims had to walk sixteen kilometres along the Sacred Way, an awe-inspiring road lined with regal statues and tombs. Many important historical figures would travel this very path hoping to gain Apollo's favour in later centuries, including Alexander the Great himself.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_main_core_coastal_fishermen	While the societies of the Late Bronze Age relied heavily on agriculture and animal husbandry to supply their dietary needs, the presence of fish bones in the archaeological record indicates the sea played a critical role in feeding populations, especially along the coast. Long before they were employed in war, ships criss-crossed the Aegean in large fishing fleets, hunting for prey to ensnare with nets or hunt with spears.

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_unit_siege_tower	While the Trojan Horse described in the Homeric myths is most likely apocryphal, a few theories have been proposed to explain its historical origins. One hypothesis suggests that it may have referred to a siege tower; while the earliest recorded account of such structures only dates back to the Neo-Assyrians of the 9th century BC, such machines were often constructed in the shapes of animals and were covered in dampened horse hides to defend against flaming arrows. If such weapons were employed against Troy, their true nature could have been lost through gradual embellishments in successive oral accounts.	true

There are many theories for the so-called 'Dorian Invasion' that pushed them to emigrate south from their native land in modern-day Macedonia; one of them posits that they fled aggression from the same mysterious Sea Peoples who may have later caused the collapse of major civilisations around the Aegean, including mighty Mycenae itself.	true

Subterfuge and treachery, while less inspiring to poets, were used whenever engaging a numerically superior foe would guarantee defeat. Shrewd Odysseus himself was renown for his use of deceit to overpower his enemies – his conception of the Trojan Horse is a spectacular example of employing covert methods to overcome an otherwise invincible opponent.	true

Following a land battle, you may take prisoners captive or kill them. Each option has certain benefits and disadvantages (bonuses to morale or replenishment, for instance, depending on your choice). After a siege battle there are different options – choose to occupy the settlement and make it yours or sack or loot it for short-term monetary gain balanced by greater damage and public order penalties.

Their luxurious diet included fatty meat, spiced wine, and luxurious oils, and every occasion big and small was a pretext for a glorious feast. Entertainment came in the form of music, but also from epic poetry, which bards recited from memory from one generation to the next. The Iliad itself was most likely one such poem, retold time and again through centuries after the Trojan War.	true

Gaining favour is not a straightforward process, however, as any favour gains will slowly fade away due to neglect for matters divine.

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_amazons_penthesilea_scouts	Throughout history, military victories have been highly dependent on intelligence, often acquired through extensive reconnaissance beforehand. During the Late Bronze Age, scouts were selected among skirmishers who, eschewing protection for mobility, could move across the land swiftly and unseen. A skilled scout was able to blend in with the local population, and thus observe the enemy without arousing suspicion. Archaeological evidence suggests that the first horse riders did so to scout across vast distances quickly, a practice which, given the lack of proper riding technique at the time, would have proven exceptionally uncomfortable for both rider and mount.	true

A prominent approach to interpreting Greek myth is the Euhemeristic theory, dating from the 4th century BC. It suggests that stories of supernatural events and monsters are rooted in a poetic re-telling of history when considering things outside of the Greeks’ established worldview. As such, creatures like centaurs, giants and others were likely foreign tribes whose peculiar appearance and customs gave rise to incredible, exaggerated tales.	true

The military lifestyle was punctuated by rituals such as feasts and funerary rites that bolstered brotherhood, and soldiers were encouraged to forge deep-lasting bonds with their comrades. Tradition holds that Nestor, hailed in the Iliad for his experience and wisdom, was the first to organise army units along ethnic and tribal lines in an effort to foster kinship, courage, and interdependence on the field of battle, a practice that continued into the Iron Age.	true

When his Trojan allies led the charge against the newly-built Achaean wall, Sarpedon and his steadfast Lycians held the battlements and were the first to enter the rival camp.

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_amazons_unit_toxares	The preferred type of bow in Anatolia during the Late Bronze Age was constructed from bone, wood, and horn glued together. This composite weapon was more sturdy and flexible, and could fire with greater power despite its compact size. The chariot was the favoured mode of transportation of archers, as it offered a much more stable mobile firing platform than horseback. One persistent myth about the Amazons claims that they amputated their own breasts to perform better at archery: this legend is unlikely to be true, as the practice would have lead to major health risks with no discernible benefit.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_main_troy_unique	The rulers of Achaea coveted magnificent Troy for its strategic position at the mouth of the Hellespont and for the riches held in its stores. According to myth, its mighty walls were built by the gods Poseidon and Apollo themselves; it took the full might of the assembled Achaean host and the shrewd thinking of King Odysseus to breach the almost-impregnable defences and sack the city after a decade of war. Long thought to have been a mere legend, the ruins of the Trojan city-state were uncovered in 1866 in northeast Turkey, confirming its historicity.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_unit_envoy	As a fully-fledged writing system had yet to emerge in Mycenaean times, the spoken word played a major role in the preservation and dissemination of critical information. The kings of the Late Bronze Age often relied on envoys, sharp-witted men who memorised royal edicts and could sway populations and foreign rulers to their cause. As the keepers of important knowledge, they could also serve as covert operators, spreading lies and disinformation to their king's benefit throughout enemy territory, or shoring up support for the war effort at home.	true
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_game_guide_campaign_UI_prebattle_panel	When a battle is instigated, the Pre-battle panel presents you with several options for resolving the situation – in 3D and real-time on the battlefield, automatic resolution, or withdrawing from the fight. Whenever an assault takes place, the relative strength of the opposing sides is indicated on the Balance of Power bar; this both informs you of your odds of success and determines how likely it is that you will be victorious if the battle is automatically resolved. The panels on either side of the screen display the attacking and defending forces along with their commanding Heroes, reinforcements, equipment, army effects, and any runes or banners available to assign to units under their command. Those Heroes’ armies that will reinforce your chosen force can be viewed by selecting their portrait. The order in which reinforcing Heroes appear on the battle map can also be set using the arrows located to the left of their portraits. If you are fielding more than twenty units they will automatically be fielded as a single force by default; if you wish to only control twenty units at a time and have any others appear as reinforcements you must uncheck the box on the Pre-Battle panel. Lastly, the scout terrain feature enables you to preview the entire 3D battlefield, detailing its deployment zones and giving indications of key tactical points that can be used to your advantage.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_main_core_gold_settlement	Already well-known in Neolithic times, gold has been prized for its beauty and scarcity going as far back as the 4th millennium BC. Coveted the world over, the precious metal empowered trade around the Aegean and beyond, and was frequently used in the crafting of luxury items such as rings or necklaces. As the Late Bronze Age kingdoms had yet to invent currency, golden objects were particularly useful in commerce, allowing merchants travelling as far as Egypt to barter using jewellery and other valuable works of art.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_agamemnon_mycenae	At the onset of the Trojan War, godlike Agamemnon commanded the largest fleet ever to sail the Aegean Sea. Driven by an all-encompassing lust for power and glory, the king of Mycenae rallied the many kingdoms of Achaea against Troy, determined to raze the fabled city to the ground in pursuit of his bloody ambition.\\n\\nThe aging warrior still inspired awe on the battlefield with his heavy armour and the mighty swings of his mace. He and his younger brother Menelaus shared a thirst for revenge against Paris, who had seduced the Spartan ruler's wife and fled across the waters with her.\\n\\nThe Mycenaean leader's formidable will was also the source of his hubris. In the Iliad, Homer recounts how Agamemnon, through arrogance and unyielding pride, offended Apollo himself, then later provoked Achilles into withdrawing the support of his Myrmidons, with disastrous results.	true

Javelins, often carried in pairs by Achaean soldiers, were shorter and lighter than thrusting spears; they could be thrown, or wielded with deadly efficiency at close range in conjunction with figure-of-eight shields.

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_game_guide_campaign_UI_siege_panel	Whenever a walled settlement is attacked the Siege panel appears. Like the Pre-battle panel, it displays important information such as the Balance of Power bar and details of the opposing forces, as well as giving you the options to control large armies or preview the 3D battlefield's terrain. Importantly, the Siege panel enables the on-site construction of siege engines such as battering rams and towers. Direct assaults on walled settlements are not possible without first having siege units in your force to bring the walls or doors down – therefore, in the event that there are no specialist siege engines in a besieging force, the option to attack will be unavailable until they have been constructed. Select a siege engine card to queue its construction, then choose to continue with the siege to allow time for the engines to be constructed, which may be several turns. Once your siege engine(s) are ready, select your besieging army again and right-click on the settlement to bring up the Siege panel – the attack options will now be active. Of course, you are also free to continue besieging a settlement until the defenders have been starved sufficiently to surrender without a fight, but be aware that they may sally out of the settlement to try and break the siege through a pitched battle.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_unit_centaur	Despite the preference for charioteering in the Late Bronze Age, there were a few tribes who, lacking the technological means or resources to build wagons of their own, developed a crude form of horseback warfare instead. Riding their steeds without a saddle, they could have been easily confused by an uncomprehending enemy as a single fantastical creature with the body of a horse and a human torso.

It is even likely that kings themselves fulfilled priestly functions, thus strengthening their legitimacy in the eyes of a superstitious population.

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_envoy	As a fully-fledged writing system had yet to emerge in Mycenaean times, the spoken word played a major role in the preservation and dissemination of critical information.

The carriage, always drawn by two horses, required one dedicated charioteer, leaving the other warriors on board free to strike at ground units with spears, or fire at them using composite bows. The chariot's intimidating size, as well as its high speed and manoeuvrability, made it both the tank and the armoured personnel carrier of its day.	true

The most famous of these stories recounts how Heracles travelled to Themiscyra to claim Hippolyta's girdle as his own for his ninth labour, while another describes how the Thracian hero Penthesilea fought on Troy's side in the Trojan War.

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_unit_giants	History is rife with myths of gigantic human beings living on the fringes of civilisation around the globe. Given the lack of supporting archaeological evidence, it is likely such legends arose from encounters with tribes of taller, broader men whose might made an impression on the battlefield. As the tales of their fearful size grew bolder with time, these men became towering, unearthly creatures. In Mycenaean Greece, the giants were considered the mortal descendants of the mighty Titans, forebears of the gods, whom Zeus and the Olympians conquered during the 'Titanomachy' to win rightful dominion over the world.	true
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_odysseus	Shrewd and resourceful Odysseus, ruler of Ithaca, was a brilliant diplomat and a trusted advisor to the kings of Achaea. In the Iliad, Lord Agamemnon, in his hour of need, beseeched him to convince Achilles to re-join the war effort. A wise, battle-hardened commander who believed that the path to victory lay in stealth rather than direct confrontation, he is said to have been the mastermind behind the Trojan Horse, an ingenious stratagem that led to the downfall of the great city.\\n\\nA formidable combatant in his own right, Odysseus nevertheless preferred to employ subterfuge and guerrilla tactics to defeat his opponents. He fired at his enemies from afar wielding a mighty bow that only he could string. He was also renowned as an accomplished seaman and keen naval strategist: the Ithacan general's ten-year journey at sea following his victory against Troy is the subject of Homer's second epic poem, 'The Odyssey'.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_unit_sword	The Late Bronze Age saw the introduction of the highly-successful Naue Type II sword, also called 'grip-tongue', which would remain in widespread use across Europe well into the Iron Age, five hundred years later. While previous blades were employed for stabbing in the manner of a long dagger, this design allowed warriors to slash through flesh or armour without the risk of their weapons breaking at the hilt. This versatile addition to Anatolian battlefields allowed soldiers much  greater mobility, and often proved decisive for both defence and offence.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_unit_dendra_armour	While Achaean heavy infantry typically relied on helmets and shields for defence, the Late Bronze Age saw the introduction of improved metal armour offering full-body coverage. Fashioned out of bronze and held together by leather thongs, this state-of-the-art protection offered a full range of motion by pushing Achaean metalworking to its limits. Despite this, movement remained cumbersome due to the suit's weight, thus rendering wearers vulnerable to a light swordsmen charge. For this reason, heavy infantry was best deployed in conjunction with light infantry to guard the flanks.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_main_core_mountain_hunter	Warriors of the Aegean thought of hunting as a valorous and noble activity, both a rite of passage for young men and a form of training for warfare. Hunters tracked their prey using similar weapons to those they carried in combat: representations in art dating to the time of the Trojan War depict soldiers facing fearsome animals such as lions with shields, bows, and spears. For this reason, Artemis, goddess of the hunt and twin sister to Apollo, was favoured across the region; even the mighty Spartans of the Classical period offered her a sacrifice before undertaking any military campaign.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_main_core_bronze_smelter	Most metals occur in nature primarily as minerals and require smelting to separate them from other components such as silica and alumina. The ores are first roasted in open air to produce oxides, then heated at high temperatures to turn them into metal. While the elements required to create bronze were known as far back as 5500BC, it took three thousand years until the discovery of the alloy, created by combining copper and tin to form a sturdier, easier-to-cast substance that would revolutionise warfare around the Aegean and beyond.	true

As such, they do not generally have to be activated, although an attribute may bestow an ability activated by a button on the battle HUD. For example, some units are inherently fearsome, so their very presence in battle can cause fear in an enemy, reducing their morale.

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_unit_seer	The gift of prophecy, bestowed upon a chosen few by mighty Apollo, played a critical role in Achaean and Anatolian societies. Through their alleged ability of divine foretelling, the seers of the Late Bronze Age wielded immense power over the course of history, and kings and conquerors throughout the ages, including Alexander the Great himself, often based their decisions on their cryptic words. Such was the respect afforded the oracles, they were considered infallible even when their predictions failed – when events occurred contrary to a prediction, it was the interpreter's fault for misunderstanding the prophet's flawless but enigmatic pronouncements.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_main_core_forest_carpenter	While no piece of carved wood has survived the centuries since the Late Bronze Age, archaeological evidence suggests that the Achaeans were already well versed in the art of woodworking. Lathes have been recovered from ancient Mycenaean sites, suggesting that woodturning was practiced in the region long before the Trojan War.

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_main_pylos_baths	The city of Pylos was not as heavily fortified as other Achaean sites because of its strategic position overlooking the Bay of Navarino and the reputation of its wise king, Nestor, as a man of peace. The royal palace featured ornate baths made of terracotta, called 'asaminthos', where servants poured warm water over the lounging elite before anointing them in perfumed oils. It is here that, according to Homer's 'Odyssey', Nestor's youngest daughter Polykaste bathed Odysseus' son Telemachus.

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_amazons_penthesilea_main	Nomadism, where a group of humans follow the seasonal availability of wild plants and game, was humanity's very first subsistence method. While a sedentary lifestyle offered many benefits including agriculture and the emergence of a specialised military class, many peoples remained nomads long into the Late Bronze Age and beyond. Nomadic tribes often clashed with agrarian nations who didn't take kindly to intruders on their lands, but there are indications that both types of societies gained from each other: migratory groups fostered trade by moving goods over large distances, and in turn benefited from the expertise of artisans and farmers.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_troy_myth_artemis_huntresses	Ancient tradition on the Attican peninsula dictated that young women on the verge of puberty were to travel to the Temple of Artemis, where they would 'act the bear' for one year as they transitioned into womanhood. During this time, these charges were called 'arktoi', or 'little she-bears', and lived in the wild under the patronage of the goddess of the hunt, learning to wield the bow and live off the land.

They were narrow and featured a single open deck, from which crewmen wielded long spears to stab at enemies from across the bow.

This may involve adding a barter of resources. When the negative number hits zero or higher, the other Hero will be willing to agree.

It is important to note that an attacker cannot initiate a siege battle against a walled settlement without first building at least one piece of siege equipment or having a unit with the Confident Besieger or Siege Expert trait (such as the Cyclops or Minotaur) in their army. 	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_campaign_sieges_sallying_out_1	In some situations, it may be advantageous for an army stationed in a besieged settlement to sally forth and engage the attacking army on open land. If the defender's supplies run low and they begin suffering attrition for example, they could fight the besieging army in open battle sooner, rather than defending the city in a siege battle later on, with severely weakened forces.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_amazons_penthesilea_military	Given the momentous yet unpredictable nature of war, it comes as no surprise that the ancient Greeks, including Homer himself, attributed its many twists and turns to the whims of Zeus and his court. The peoples of the Late Bronze Age Aegean considered warfare the province of not one, but two Olympians: Athena represented the more honourable aspects of battle, while dark Ares embodied its grimmer, bloodier side. Athena was worshipped far and wide, but Ares was rarely celebrated in either Achaea or Anatolia, though no sane warrior would fail to honour him before joining the fray.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_unit_mounted_archery	Given that the Amazon people were most likely of Scythian origin, it is a distinct possibility that they too practiced mounted archery. Shooting a bow from horseback required great riding skills, which is consistent with depictions of Amazons in Greek legend. These horse archers would have been experts skirmishers, using their mounts' speed to get close to the enemy, then fleeing as they fired arrows backwards, thus thinning the enemy's numbers and crushing their morale. They would have wielded shorter bows than usual, trading range and penetration power for mobility and manoeuvrability.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_unit_islanders	While the numerous clans of the Achaean mainland had already begun to coalesce into city-states by 3100BC, the peoples of the Aegean Islands, whose remote locations limited contacts with foreigners, retained their tribal lifestyle until 2300BC. What happened to these islanders beyond this period is unclear. One theory holds that they were chased from their homes by foreign conquerors and forced to resort to piracy to survive; if true, this would explain the mysterious Sea Peoples, nomads who may have contributed to the collapse of many major civilisations around the Mediterranean at the end of the Bronze Age.	true

Originally from Arcadia, he was forced to flee his homeland following a great flood, setting sail for the Troad, where he founded a city bearing his name. During the Trojan War, the Dardanian forces were led by the mighty hero Aeneas; according to Roman myths, he and his men fled to Italy following the Fall of Troy, where they became the progenitors of the Roman people.

You will be notified on the Events panel, or with a pop-up at the beginning of your turn. Some events are one-offs, linked to the dynamics of the Aegean, but many occur in the form of dilemmas. A dilemma is an event which prompts you to make a decision, the results of which effect both you and your and campaign – so choosing arbitrarily is inadvisable. Once you have made a decision, the results of your choice are revealed immediately or several turns later. Some result in further choice, leading to a short quest chain of sorts, whilst others result in a final event message, detailing the consequences of your actions.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_main_core_coastal_port	Designed to be light and fast, the ships of the Late Bronze Age could be dragged at sea or rammed on to the beach, so did not always require deep harbours for deployment or maintenance. Coastal settlements were often established some distance from the waterfront, favouring a better defensive position over easy access to the water. This was the case even for well-guarded Troy, which occupied a strategic maritime location at the mouth of the Hellespont, but was built away from the shore to allow Trojan defenders to engage the enemy on the plains before the city.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_main_core_loggers	As the demand for bronze weapons and armour increased in the centuries preceding the Trojan War, so did the need for fuel to support metalworking efforts. Systematic logging put tremendous pressure on the region's forests; it took more than a hundred pine trees to produce the charcoal necessary to forge a single copper ingot, leading to the deforestation of the Mycenaean mainland and the Cycladic islands. This would eventually lead to a decline in the production of bronze, laying the groundwork for the invention of steel and the advent of the Iron Age.	true

Like their Scythian predecessors who may have invented horseback riding, these female warriors would have been skilful horsewomen, employing their awe-inspiring mobility to outflank and harass their enemies. The Amazons' favoured weapons were the bow and arrow, as well as a double-headed axe called labrys, which they were trained from childhood to wield effectively from the backs of horses.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_campaign_garrisons_1	Each settlement maintains a garrison force as protection in the event that an enemy army attacks. The composition of a garrison – which units it contains and how many – is defined by the buildings in the settlement and the level of its main building chain. The garrison building chain specifically generates extra garrison units, and is therefore useful in settlements under constant threat, such as those on your borders.

If, before merging, there are not enough troops to form a full unit when the two are combined, they will become a single unit fighting at less than full strength – e.g. 100/120. However, if the total number of troops exceed the maximum size, then one remains smaller whilst the other unit will be replenished entirely.

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_main_core_bronze_trader	The increasing demand for rare metals in the Late Bronze Age led to the strengthening of commercial ties between Mycenae, Anatolia, and many other foreign powers as far as the Baltic and Central Asia. This was especially true for tin, a critical component in the creation of bronze, which was excessively scarce in Mycenaean Greece and had to be imported at great cost from distant lands.

Legend claims the great Perseus slayed the gorgon Medusa, avoiding her petrifying stare by looking at her in the reflection of his shield. The Hero later gave the monster's head to Athena, who, according to Homer, affixed it to her mighty aegis.

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_unit_trojan_bow	Employed for hunting as far back as 2500BC, the bow maintained its relevance on Anatolian battlefields thanks to the invention of composite construction techniques. By gluing together wood, horn, tendons and sinew, craftsmen of the Late Bronze Age created a sturdier, more compact weapon that could be fired with much greater accuracy. These proved especially valuable to Trojan soldiers, who won many engagements against would-be invaders by raining death on them from atop the city's walls.	true

Their ruler, Aeneas, was first cousin once removed to King Priam, and is often praised in the Iliad for his valour in combat. The fertile lands of the Dardanians could support a large population of young men who lacked combat training, but who contributed to the Trojan war effort with their sheer numbers and a willingness to die in the defence of their homeland.

Troy's very best warriors were educated from an early age in the art of warfare, and were encouraged to display both valour and strategic cunning in the face of the enemy.

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_main_core_garrison	As conflicts intensified around the Aegean in the Late Bronze Age, settlements increasingly relied on massive walls to defend themselves. The gates built into these structures played a key strategic role, forcing invading enemies into narrow spaces or choke points where their numeric advantage could be negated. This was the case of the famous Lion Gate at Mycenae, which featured a reinforced bastion on its right side; as warriors carried their shields on their left arm, the Mycenaeans could rain arrows upon them from their exposed flank to predictably devastating effect.	true
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_main_core_recruitment_melee	While epic tales such as the Iliad are more concerned with the heroes of the battlefield, the bulk of the armies on either side of the Trojan War were composed of commoners pressed into service, slaves, and professional soldiers. Farmers could be trained into skirmishers with minimal effort, as many of them were already familiar with slings and bows from hunting. While bronze armour and weapons were reserved for skilled heavy infantry, fresh recruits were given little or no protection, and not much was expected from them in battle besides a useful death.	true
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_hippolyta	Hippolyta (meaning 'Wild Horse' or 'Free Rider') was the queen of the Amazons at the end of the Bronze Age. While the younger Penthesilea led their vengeful sisters to war, she was chiefly concerned with securing a peaceful future for her people.\\n\\nA seasoned veteran by the time of the Trojan War, her previously fiery character had been tempered by years of fighting such legendary figures as Theseus and Heracles. Also a skilled diplomat, she was a consummate peacemaker whose single obsession was the establishment of an Amazon kingdom that would endure the ages.\\n\\nIn mythology, Hippolyta was Ares' daughter, and the Olympian bestowed upon her a magic girdle to symbolise her rule. It was this item that Heracles was tasked to retrieve for his ninth labour – the legendary warrior stealing Hippolyta’s prized belt and sailing away with it.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_unit_spears	While the sword was well on its way to dominating the Anatolian battlefields of the Late Bronze Age, the spear remained the Trojan warrior's weapon of choice right up to the fall of the great city. Crafted from a wooden shaft and a sharpened bronze head, the weapon was especially useful in the initial charge, but often proved unwieldy at close quarters. Spearmen were especially vulnerable to light swordsmen, who would outflank them or move past their spear lines to deal them crippling blows.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_main_mycenae_walls	Fortified Mycenae was the most important Achaean settlement in the Late Bronze Age, giving its name to the dominant civilisation of prehistoric mainland Greece. Its walls were erected from massive, seemingly-unshaped stones that were so awe-inspiring, they were believed to have been assembled by the Cyclopes of legend. The entire fortress, from its strategic position between two ravines to the ingenious design of its mighty Lion Gate, was designed to spread and inconvenience invaders, making Agamemnon's capital almost impregnable. The once-powerful city would eventually fall around 1100BC, long after Mycenaean society itself had collapsed.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_description_unit_ambushers	For all the talk of honour and valour in the Iliad, surprise and trickery were as much a constant of the Trojan War as any other conflict throughout history. With one well-placed javelin or arrow, or one daring raid, a small band of warriors could overpower a superior opponent and turn the tide of an entire war. Ranged weapons were ideally suited for ambush warfare, as they allowed light-armoured ambushers to strike from a distance and flee the scene before their enemy could retaliate.	true

Like their Scythian predecessors who may have invented horseback riding, these female warriors would have been skilful horsewomen, employing their awe-inspiring mobility to outflank and harass their enemies.

This was most likely the case on both sides of the Trojan War, as both armies would have relied on foreign soldiers to bolster their forces.

To them, the trees were inhabited by beautiful but deadly creatures called nymphs, with whom the beastly god Pan cavorted freely, while Artemis, goddess of the hunt, watched over wild animals and killed any who dared harm one of her sacred beasts.

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_main_core_warehouse	While the palaces of the Aegean Bronze Age were designed to impress and project a king's might, they were primarily erected for a much simpler purpose: survival. Fortresses were built with a protected access to water whenever possible, and featured storage rooms that could hold enough food to sustain a protracted siege. The goods hoarded inside included dried meat, grain, olive oil, and wine, all of which were acquired by the ruler through taxation of the local population. More than gold, these stores were the true measure of a kingdom's worth.	true

According to Homer's 'Odyssey', Odysseus himself encountered one in his travels. One possible explanation for these striking creatures can be found in the use by primitive tribes of dwarf mammoth skull helmets during the Bronze Age: their large nasal cavity could have been misinterpreted by Aegeans as a single eye socket, inspiring tall tales of their wearers' uncanny appearance and mythical origins.	true

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_hp_building_description_amazons_hippolyta_mounds	A widespread practice around the world dating as far back as the 4th millennium BC, burial mounds may be as old as the concept of funeral rites. The custom possibly dates back to the early Indo-European peoples of the Caucasus, who may have spread it into northern and eastern Europe and across Anatolia. At the time of the Trojan War, the structure was still favoured by Anatolians and Achaeans alike: according to the Iliad, Achilles himself erected a burial mound for his fallen companion Patroclus after cremating him on a funeral pyre.	true

The resulting stores were essential to the survival of the ruling elite in the event of drought or siege, and as such were often considered more precious than gold; royal granaries were built from stone or brick and were often the most heavily-guarded buildings in an entire city.	true
